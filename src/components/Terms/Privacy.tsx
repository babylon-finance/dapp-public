      <h2>3. Cookies & Tracking Data</h2>
      <p>
        We may use third-party analytics and other tracking mechanisms to track Visitors to the Site. These tracking
        mechanisms may automatically collect information about your visits to the Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        A cookie is a file containing an identifier that is sent by a web server to a browser and is stored by the
        browser. The identifier is then sent back to the server each time the browser requests a page from the server.
        Cookies may not contain any information that personally identifies a user, but personal data that we store about
        you may be linked to the information stored in and obtained from cookies. To the extent that cookies that are
        not strictly necessary for the provision of Site, we will ask you to consent to such use of cookies when you
        first visit the Site.
      </p>
      <p>We use cookies for the following purposes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Performance – These cookies used specifically for gathering data on how Visitors use the Site, which pages of
          the Site are visited most often, or if they get error messages on web pages. These cookies only monitor the
          performance of the Site as Visitors interact with it. These cookies do not collect your Personal Data, which
          means all the data collected is anonymous and only used to improve the functionality of the Site.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>4. What Are Our Legal Bases for Processing Personal Data?</h2>
      <p>
        We process Personal Data to further our own legitimate interests, which may include:
        <ul>
          <li>Operating the Site</li>
          <li>Researching and analyzing Site usage</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>5. How Do We Use Personal Data?</h2>
      <p>We may process your Personal Data to improve, modify, and measure the performance of our Site and Services.</p>
      <h2>6. Do We Disclose Personal Data?</h2>
      <p>
        We may work with third parties to facilitate our Services or to assist us in analyzing how our Services are
        used. As such, we may disclose Personal Data with those third parties.
      </p>
      <h2>7. Information for California Consumers </h2>
      <p>The information and rights in this section apply specifically to California residents.</p>
      <p>
        Babylon does not sell, trade, or rent out our Visitor’s Personal Data for compensation, nor have we done so in
        the preceding 12 months.
      </p>
      <p>
        California residents are entitled to contact us to request information about whether we have disclosed Personal
        Data to third parties for the third parties’ direct marketing purposes. Currently, BABYLON does not disclose
        Personal Data to third parties for direct marketing purposes. Thus, upon receipt of such a request by a
        California consumer, and as required by California state law, we will either (1) respond with a confirmation
        that we have not disclosed any Personal Data to third parties in the previous calendar year, or (2) if our
        practices have changed, we will provide the categories of Personal Data that has been shared in the past 12
        months and categories of third parties to whom such Personal Data was disclosed, whichever is relevant.
      </p>
      <p>California consumers have the right to:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Request disclosure of the categories and specific pieces of Personal Data that BABYLON has collected about
          you;
        </li>
        <li>
          Request disclosure of the categories of third-party sources, if any, from which BABYLON has collected Personal
          Data about you;
        </li>
        <li>Receive a list of the categories of third parties with whom BABYLON has shared your Personal Data;</li>
        <li>
          Request that BABYLON delete any Personal Data that it has collected from you (subject to exceptions); and
        </li>
        <li>
          Not be discriminated against by BABYLON (e.g., charged different rates, provided different levels of service,
          denied goods or services, or suggested any of the preceding) for exercising any of the individual rights
          granted above.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To exercise any of your rights as a California consumer, you can submit a request to privacy@babylon.finance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before complying with your request, we will need to verify that it is you that is making the request. To
        accomplish this, you may be requested to (1) confirm specific Personal Data that we already know about you; or
        (2) provide us with appropriate identification and documentation. California consumers are limited to two
        requests for Personal Data per 12-month period. Only you or an authorized agent may make a verifiable data
        subject request related to your Personal Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The verifiable data subject request must provide sufficient information and documentation to allow us to verify
        that you (or an authorized agent) are the person about whom we collected Personal Data. We will not provide you
        with Personal Data if we cannot verify your identity and/or authority to make the data subject request and
        confirm the Personal Data belongs to you or the represented individual. Making a verifiable data subject request
        does not require you to create an account with us. We use Personal Data provided in a verifiable data subject
        request solely to verify the requestor's identity or authority to make the request.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will acknowledge receipt of your data request within 10 days. We will respond to a verifiable data subject
        request within 45 days of its receipt. If we require more time (up to 90 days), we will inform you of the reason
        and extension period. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our response to the email address for that
        account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our response by US mail or electronically at the
        email address in your request, at your option. All disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period
        preceding the verifiable employee request's receipt. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we
        cannot comply with a request, if applicable.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable data subject request unless it is excessive,
        repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we
        made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.
      </p>
      <h2>8. Your Individual Rights under the GDPR</h2>
      <p>
        Under the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) (and subject to any relevant exceptions) you have the
        right to access, correct, change, delete, restrict, exercise your right to data portability, or object to the
        processing of Personal Data.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a Visitor residing in, or located in, the EU or EEA, you can exercise your GDPR rights by submitting a
        request to privacy@babylon.finance. We may first request verification of your identity prior to facilitating the
        exercise of your rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also elect not to receive marketing communications by changing your preferences in your account, or by
        following the unsubscribe instructions in each communication.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will retain Personal Data in order to comply with legal requirements, protect our and others’ rights, resolve
        disputes, or enforce our legal terms or policies, to the extent permitted under applicable law.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may also lodge a complaint with an EU/EEA data protection authority for your country or region where you
        have your habitual residence or place of work or where an alleged infringement of applicable data protection law
        occurs.
      </p>
      <p>Your principal rights under the GDPR are:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Right to access - you can ask us for copies of your Personal Data;</li>
        <li>
          Right to rectification - you can ask BABYLON to update/correct any inaccurate Personal Data and to complete

          and
        </li>
        <li>
          Right to withdraw consent - to the extent that the legal basis of our processing of your Personal Data is
          consent, you can withdraw that consent.
        </li>
      </ul>
