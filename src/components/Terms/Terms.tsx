        Agreement.
      </p>

        {' '}
        If you are an individual accessing or using the Site on behalf of, or for the benefit of, any corporation,

      </p>
      <h2>Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        This Site is offered and available to users who are 18 years of age or older, or, if the registered user is an
        Organization, you represent that you have the right, power and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf
        of the Organization and bind the Organization to its terms. If the registered user does not agree to these
        Terms, we will not provide our services and you must not use the Site or any of our services. Without limiting
        the foregoing, by using our Site, you acknowledge and understand that laws regarding financial instruments,
        which sometimes include Crypto Assets (as defined below), may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and it is
        your obligation alone to ensure that you fully comply with any law, regulation or directive, relevant to your
        jurisdiction with regard to the use of our Site. For the avoidance of doubt, the ability to access our Site does
        not necessarily mean that our Site, or your activities through it, are legal under the laws, regulations or
        directives relevant to your jurisdiction. All of our Site or the services made available through our Site may
        not be available to all users, and we reserve the right to assess or reassess at any time your eligibility to
        use all or part of our Site. Our Site does not constitute, and may not be used for the purposes of, an offer or
        solicitation to anyone in any jurisdiction in which such offer or solicitation is not authorized, or to any
        person to whom it is unlawful to make such an offer or solicitation.
      </p>
      <h2>Gardens and Wallets</h2>
      <p>
        Through use of the Site, individuals can interact with the Ethereum blockchain to create financial communities
        ("Gardens") and to acquire, mint, redeem, and programmatically realign strategies on Gardens without
        intermediaries while remaining in control of their Crypto Assets. These Gardens rebalance signals are generated
        through predefined, algorithmic logic encoded into smart contracts. Gardens come from third party signal
        providers ("Creators"). “Crypto Assets” as used in this Agreement, refers to ERC20 tokens, implemented on the
        Ethereum blockchain using smart contracts, which tokens include any Garden created using the Babylon.finance
        protocol. Babylon.finance does not endorse any particular Garden or otherwise officially advise you with respect
        to a particular Garden, and any predefined Gardens made available on the Site are not intended to be
        personalized financial advice to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        To access the services on the Site, including to create a Garden or a Strategy, you must have access to a
        compatible virtual currency wallet (“Wallet”) that supports ERC20 tokens. Any Crypto Assets you acquire through
        the Site will be held and administered solely by you through your Wallet, and we shall have no access to or
        responsibility in regard to your Wallet or any Crypto Asset held in your Wallet. It is solely your
        responsibility to determine what Wallet software to use in connection with the Site, and your use of such
        Wallets are subject to any governing terms of use or privacy policy of such Wallet. While the Company has added
        support for certain Wallets and Crypto Assets on the site, you acknowledge and agree that we are under no
        obligation to add additional support for other Wallets or other Crypto Assets, and that the inclusion of any
        particular Wallet or Crypto Asset is not an endorsement by us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Babylon.finance will not create a hosted Wallet for you or otherwise custody or store Crypto Assets on your
        behalf, and it is your sole responsibility to maintain the security of and access to your Wallet. In the event
        that you lose access to your Wallet, a private key, password, or other method of securing your Wallet, any funds
        may be irretrievable, and Babylon.finance will be unable to assist you in any way. You hereby irrevocably waive,
        release and discharge all claims, whether known or unknown to you, against Babylon.finance, its affiliates and
        their respective shareholders, members, directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives related to
        your use of any Wallet software, associated loss of funds, transaction failures, or any other defects that arise
        in the course of your use of your Wallet, including any losses that may obtain as a result of any failure in
        smart contracts made available on the Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may need or be offered the opportunity to register for an account (“Account”) in order to access some or all
        of the services on the Site. When you register for an Account, you must provide accurate information about
        yourself and promptly update this information if it changes. You must also maintain the security of your Account
        and promptly notify us if you discover or suspect that someone has accessed your Account without your
        permission. If you permit others to use your Account credentials, you are responsible for the activities of such
        users that occur in connection with your Account. We reserve the right to reclaim usernames, including on behalf
        of businesses or individuals that hold legal claim, including trademark rights, in those usernames. We reserve
        the right to require you to submit information confirming and verifying your identity in connection with your
        registration of an Account or to otherwise use certain services on the Site, and by accepting this Agreement,
        you agree to our verification policy as determined by us from time-to-time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, all or any part of our Site
        with or without notice. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification,
        suspension or discontinuance of all or any part of our Site.
      </p>
      <p>
        THIS SITE IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PLATFORM ONLY. WE ARE NOT A BROKER, DEALER, FINANCIAL INSTITUTION, EXCHANGE,
        CUSTODIAN, ROBO-ADVISOR, INTERMEDIARY, OR CREDITOR. THE SITE DOES NOT FACILITATE TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN BUYERS AND
        SELLERS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO ANY TRANSACTIONS THAT OCCUR DURING A REBALANCE, WHICH TRANSACTIONS OCCUR ON
        THIRD-PARTY, UNAFFILIATED PLATFORMS. THE COMPANY IS NOT A COUNTERPARTY TO ANY TRANSACTION ON THE SITE OR FOR ANY
        USER OF THE SITE. NEITHER THE SITE NOR THE COMPANY PROVIDES FINANCIAL ADVISORY, LEGAL, REGULATORY, OR TAX
        SERVICES DIRECLTY, INDIRECTLY, IMPLICITLY, OR IN ANY OTHER MANNER, AND YOU SHOULD NOT CONSIDER ANY CONTENT
        CONTAINED IN THIS AGREEMENT OR OTHERWISE POSTED ON THE SITE TO BE A SUBSTITUTE FOR PROFESSIONAL FINANCIAL,
        LEGAL, REGULATORY, TAX OR OTHER ADVICE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT SUPPORT OR ENDORSE ANY GARDEN, AND EACH GARDEN AND
        ITS COMMUNITY IS AN INDEPENDENT AGENT WITH NO EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE COMPANY.
      </p>
      <h2>Community-led Asset Management</h2>
      <p>
        As part of the services offered on the Site, you have the ability to follow a community and interact with its
        members by utilizing the social trading features made available on the Site (collectively, “Community-led Asset
        Management”). Community-led Asset Management allows you to subscribe to and collaborate with the members of a
        community you with the ability to execute code on the Ethereum blockchain that will automatically mirror the
        Garden strategies for all the users on the Site. You acknowledge and agree that, once initiated, Community-led
        Asset Management will automatically result in the execution of certain transactions in accordance with
        strategies created and approved by the community, and hereby consent to such automatic execution. Community-led
        Asset Management also includes tools to test, evaluate, and vote for strategies by providing you with detailed
        strategy information, trading history and other pertinent information (“Information”) you may want to consider
        before electing to subscribe to a Garden. We may also provide information to you about your transactions,
        including procedures, risks, and other factual market information. However, we are under no obligation to
        provide such Information to you and if we do, it will not constitute investment advice and is intended solely
        for informational purposes. In the event that we are ever acting as Garden creators, we will specifically
        identify Babylon.finance as being affiliated with the Company.
      </p>
      <p>
        Community-led Asset Management is a new feature and should be considered a “beta” product. In making a decision
        to participate in a Garden, you hereby represent and warrant that you have considered your entire financial
        situation including financial commitments and you understand that using Community-led Asset Management is highly
        speculative and that you could sustain significant losses, including as a result of the failure of underlying
        software. We do not provide any guarantee as to the performance of any particular transaction or set of
        transactions, portfolio or strategy, and we do not in any manner endorse, support, sanction, encourage, verify
        or agree with any Garden, portfolios or strategies. Execution of any instructions generated by our Community-led
        Asset Management services will occur exclusively on the Ethereum blockchain, and in no way shall we be
        responsible for any failure to execute any instructions or code on the Ethereum blockchain network. You hereby
        agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for any failure to execute instructions
        transmitted on the Ethereum blockchain network or any other defect that arises in connection with your use of
        the Community-led Asset Management features that are caused by a failure of the underlying blockchain network or
        smart contract code. You further represent and warrant that you have reviewed and acknowledged all of the risks
        attendant to using the Site, including the risks related to Community-led Asset Management described in this
        Agreement.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Company is not providing any portfolio management services in connection with the Site. You should carefully
        review all claims and representations made by Gardens before making a transaction decision. If you choose to
        engage in transactions based on Information or other content on the website or applications or elect to
        participate in specific Gardens, then such decisions and transactions and any consequences flowing there from
        are your sole responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should use any content or Information gathered from the Site only as a starting point for your own
        independent research and transactional decision making, and you must rely on your own judgment in entering into
        or refraining from using the Site or conducting (or not conducting) any transaction. In no event shall the
        Company be responsible or liable to you or anyone else, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss arising
        from or relating to any use, continued use or reliance on any Information or tools, including, without
        limitation, directly or indirectly resulting from errors in, omissions of or alterations to any such
        Information.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Company does not warrant the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of Information. Any reliance you place on
        Information is strictly at your own risk. We disclaim all liability and responsibility arising from any reliance
        placed on such materials by you or any other visitor to the Site, or by anyone who may be informed of any of its
        contents.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to suspend or terminate a Garden for any reason, particularly for violations of the
        Company’s policies and applicable laws. You agree that we will not be liable to you or to any third party for
        any suspension or termination of a Garden.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using the Site, you agree to be fully, independently and personally liable for each transaction made on the
        Site by you, including, without limitation, any position automatically opened as a result of using our
        Community-led Asset Management features. As such, you must make sure that you are the only person with access to
        your Wallet and/or Account at all times. You must make sure that no minors have access to your Wallet and/or
        Account. In the unlikely event that a contract is entered to acquire or sell Crypto Assets at a price that does
        not reflect the market price (such as an event where a technical error such as a bug or defect has caused a
        malfunction that has affected the price of the transaction), we reserve the right to terminate and cancel any
        such transaction to the extent technically feasible through blockchain networks. We will notify you of our
        decision to cancel the transaction and explain our reasons to you. On the other hand, you are required to inform
        us of any such malfunction should you experience such a malfunction whilst using the Site.
      </p>
      <h2>Fees</h2>
      <p>
        Some services on the site involve the use of the Ethereum blockchain network, which may require that you pay a
        fee, commonly known as “Ethereum Gas Charges,” for the computational resources required to perform a
        transaction. You acknowledge and agree that the Company has no control over:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>(a)any Ethereum blockchain transactions;</li>
        <li>(b) the method of payment of any Ethereum Gas Charges;</li>
        <li> or (c) any actual payments of Ethereum Gas Charges. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Accordingly, you must ensure that you have a sufficient balance of Ether stored at your Wallet to complete any
        transaction on the Ethereum blockchain network before initiating such transactions. We will make reasonable
        efforts to notify you of any Ethereum Gas Charges before initiating any services that require the use of the
        Ethereum blockchain network.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be subject to certain additional fees and commissions, including fees imposed by Gardens. While we do
        not currently charge for the use of any of our services or access to the Site, we reserve the right to levy
        additional fees in the future, including fees for access to Information or service fees to support the operation
        of the Site. You agree to promptly pay such fees and commissions, as set forth on the Site and as applicable to
        your Account and the transactions and services you receive, which we may modify from time to time. In the event
        that we add fees to the Site or any of our services, we will alert you in writing prior to any such fees going
        into effect. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, it is your sole responsibility to
        determine whether, and to what extent, any taxes apply to any transactions you conduct through the Site, and to
        withhold, collect, report and remit the correct amount of taxes to the appropriate tax authorities.
      </p>

      <p>
        By acceptance of this Agreement, you agree and acknowledge that the following information and content shall be

        risk, and the Company will have no liability arising out of or related to such Linked Websites and/or their
        content or any damages or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection of any purchase or use of any
        such content, goods or services available on or through any such Linked Website. Your use of any Linked Websites

      </p>
      <h2>Risks and Disclaimers</h2>
      <p>
        Use of the Site and participation in Transactions may carry financial risk. “Transactions” as used in this
        Agreement are defined as direct interactions with Babylon.finance protocol smart contracts on the Ethereum
        blockchain. You acknowledge and agree that you are aware of such risks, including the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        You acknowledge that transactions in Crypto Assets can be very risky. Crypto Assets are, by their nature, highly
        experimental, risky, volatile and Transactions are generally irreversible. You should not make any transactional
        decision without first conducting your own research. You are solely and exclusively responsible for determining
        whether any transaction, or strategy, or any other product or service is appropriate or suitable for you based
        on your own objectives and personal and financial situation. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and
        use the Site and participate in Transactions at your own risk. Understanding Crypto Assets and Transactions may
        require advanced technical knowledge. Crypto Assets are often described in exceedingly technical language that
        requires a comprehensive understanding of applied cryptography and computer science in order to appreciate the
        inherent risks of transacting Crypto Assets. Any reference to a type of token on the Site does not indicate our
        approval or disapproval of the underlying technology regarding such type of token, and should not be used as a
        substitute for your own understanding of the risks specific to each type of token. We make no warranty as to the
        suitability of the Crypto Assets referenced on the Site and assume no fiduciary duty in our relations with you.
        In entering into any Transaction, you represent that you have been, are and will be solely responsible for
        making your own independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of the Transaction and the underlying
        Crypto Assets. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice and
        experience to make your own evaluation of the merits and risks of any Transaction or any underlying token. You
        accept all consequences of participating in Transactions, including the risk that you may lose access to your
        Crypto Assets indefinitely. All Transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in this
        Agreement, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for and will in no circumstances be liable to you in
        connection with Transactions. Under no circumstances will the operation of all or any portion of the Site be
        deemed to create a relationship that includes the provision or tendering of investment advice. The prices of
        Crypto Assets are extremely volatile. Fluctuations in the price of other digital assets could materially and
        adversely affect the Crypto Assets, which may also be subject to significant price volatility. Our Service does
        not store, send, or receive Crypto Assets. Any transfer of Crypto Assets occurs within the supporting blockchain
        and not on this Service, as such transfers are generally not reversible or cancelable. You use the Community-led
        Asset Management features at your own risk, and the Company, and our affiliates, employees, clients and agents,
        will not be liable to you for any losses that you may sustain as a result of your use of such features. You
        should not make any transactional decision without first conducting your own research. You are solely and
        exclusively responsible for determining whether any transaction, or strategy, or any other product or service is
        appropriate or suitable for you based on your own objectives and personal and financial situation. All positions
        taken using a Community-led Asset Management feature shall be modified or closed automatically if and when
        modified or closed by the copied Trader, for whatsoever reason, without providing any further notice and without
        any action on your part. You should be able and prepared to bear the loss of the entire investment you made in
        such copied Trader or fund. You are fully responsible for any losses you may sustain as a result of your
        automatic execution of instructions generated as a result of the utilization of any of the Community-led Asset
        Management features. If you place additional trades or you modify or cancel an order generated by a
        Community-led Asset Management feature, you may achieve a materially different result than the Trader that you
        copied. Neither the Company nor any Trader, portfolio or strategy guarantees the future performance of your
        Crypto Asset, any specific level of performance, the success of any transaction strategy or the success of your
        overall management of the Account. When reviewing the Information, portfolio, financial performance information,
        opinions of Traders, you should not assume that the user is unbiased, independent or qualified to provide
        financial information or opinions. Past performance and risk scores have many inherent limitations and are not
        indicative of future results. No representation or guarantee is being made that any Trader will or is likely to
        achieve gains or losses similar to the past performance or risk score shown. The actual percentage gains or
        losses experienced by investors will vary depending on many factors To the maximum extent permissible under
        applicable law, neither we nor any of our affiliates will be liable for (a) any loss arising from following your
        written or oral instructions, (b) any loss that you may suffer by reason of any decision made or other action
        taken by an account elected to be copied by you, including without limitation, a Company Trader account; or (c)
        any loss arising from any investment decision made or other action taken or omitted in good faith by any copied
        account, strategy or portfolio, including, without limitation, a Company Trader account. Notwithstanding the
        foregoing, nothing in these Terms will waive or limit any rights that you may have under any applicable laws
        which may not be waived or limited. You are responsible for complying with applicable law. You agree that we are
        not responsible for determining whether or which laws may apply to your Transactions, including tax laws. You
        are advised to consult an attorney regarding of the legality of any activities on the Site. You are solely
        responsible for reporting and paying any taxes arising from your use of the Site and participation in any
        Transaction. You are aware of and accept the risk of operational challenges. The Site may experience
        sophisticated cyber-attacks, unexpected surges in activity or other operational or technical difficulties that
        may cause interruptions to or delays on the Site. You agree to accept the risk of a Transaction failure
        resulting from unanticipated or heightened technical difficulties, including those resulting from sophisticated
        attacks, and you agree not to hold us accountable for any related losses. We will not bear any liability,
        whatsoever, for any damage or interruptions caused by any Viruses that may affect your computer or other
        equipment, or any phishing, spoofing or any other type of similar activity. There are risks associated with
        using an Internet based currency, including but not limited to, the risk of hardware, software and Internet
        connections, the risk of malicious software introduction, and the risk that third parties may obtain
        unauthorized access to information stored within your wallet. You accept and acknowledge that the Company will
        not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays you may experience
        when using the Site, however caused. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies,
        and Crypto Assets is uncertain. New regulations or policies may materially adversely affect the development of
        the Auction and/or Service and the utility of Crypto Assets. You are advised to consult with legal counsel
        regarding the Site’s contents in your jurisdiction. You accept and confirm that a conflict of interest may arise
        when the interest of the Company and its affiliates competes or may appear to compete with your interests under
        this Agreement. Specifically, you hereby acknowledge and confirm that: (a) we may participate in certain
        transactions or auctions during a rebalancing period in an individual capacity ; (b) we may execute at the same
        time our own orders which may be opposite a user; (c) we may establish business, including without limitation,
        trading relationships with other issuers of financial instruments and we may have a financial interest in such
        instruments; (d) we may seek to act as a market maker and in this context there may be inherent conflicts of
        interest; and (e) we may compensate or share our revenues from your activity with our affiliates, partners or
        other similar parties performing marketing activities on our behalf. You hereby further acknowledge that we also
        may compensate Traders who you have elected to follow or copy. Babylon.finance does not currently charge fees or
        compensate individuals in a manner that would cause such conflict of interest to arise, but we reserve the right
        to do so, and you hereby acknowledge and agree that you understand the risks attendant to this potential
        conflict of interest. The Service will rely on third-party platforms such as MetaMask and Fortmatic to perform
        the transactions for the Auction of Crypto Assets. If we are unable to maintain a good relationship with such
        platform providers; if the terms and conditions or pricing of such platform providers change; if we violate or
        cannot comply with the terms and conditions of such platforms; or if any of such platforms loses market share or
        falls out of favor or is unavailable for a prolonged period of time, access to and use of the Site will suffer.
        The terms and conditions of MetaMask and/or Fortmatic will govern your use of MetaMask and/or Fortmatic and may
        be subject to update from time to time.

        The Company does not own or control the underlying software protocols which govern the operation of Crypto
        Assets available through the Site. In general, the underlying protocols are open source and anyone can use,
        copy, modify, and distribute them. The Company is not responsible for operation of the underlying protocols, and
        the Company makes no guarantee of their functionality, security, or availability. The underlying protocols are
        subject to sudden changes in operating rules (“Forks”), and such Forks may materially affect the value,
        function, or even the name of a Crypto Asset available on the Site. In the event of a Fork, we may temporarily
        suspend the Site’s operations (with or without advance notice to you) and we may (a) configure or reconfigure
        its systems or (b) decide not to support (or cease supporting) the Forked protocol entirely.
